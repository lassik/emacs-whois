# Improved whois support for GNU Emacs

This package complements (does not replace) the standard whois
functionality of GNU Emacs. It provides:

* A `whois-mode` with font-lock highlighting to make whois responses
  easier to read.

* A `whois-shell` function to make a whois query using the system
  whois program instead of Emacs' own (often not up to date) whois
  client.
