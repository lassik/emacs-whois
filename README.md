# Improved whois support for GNU Emacs

This package complements (does not replace) the standard whois
functionality of GNU Emacs. It provides:

* A `whois-mode` with font-lock highlighting to make whois responses
  easier to read.

* A `whois-shell` command to make a whois query using the system whois
  program instead of Emacs' own (often not up to date) whois client.

* A `whois-expand` command to repeat the last whois query using the
  domain registrar's own whois server.

To replace Emacs' own `whois` command with the one from this package:

```
(when (require 'whois nil t) (defalias 'whois 'whois-shell))
```
